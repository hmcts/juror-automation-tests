Scenario Outline: A response is submitted after pool is transferred to court

	Given I am on "Public" "test"

	Given a bureau owned pool is created with jurors
		| court |juror_number  | pool_number	| att_date_weeks_in_future	| owner |
		| 452   |<juror_number>| <pool_number>	| -1			            | 400	|

	Given a new pool is inserted for where record has transferred to the court new schema
		| part_no        | pool_no       | owner |
		| <juror_number> | <pool_number> | 452   |

	And juror "<juror_number>" has "LAST_NAME" as "<last_name>" new schema
	And juror "<juror_number>" has "POSTCODE" as "<postcode>" new schema
	
	# Attempt to submit response
	And I set the radio button to "I am replying for myself"
	And I press the "Continue" button

	When I set "9-digit juror number" to "<juror_number>"
	When I set "Juror last name" to "<last_name>"
	When I set "Juror postcode" to "<postcode>"
	And I press the "Continue" button

	Then I see "You can no longer complete this summons reply online" on the page
	Then I see "This is because the summons date has passed. You must contact us by phone or email." on the page
	And I see "/steps/login/summons-date" in the URL
