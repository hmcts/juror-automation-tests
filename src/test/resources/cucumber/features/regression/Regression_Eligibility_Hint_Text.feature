	|To be eligible for jury service, your main address must have been in one of the following for any period of at least 5 years:|
	|UK|
	|Channel Islands|
	|Isle of Man|
	|This period must have been after your 13th birthday.|
	|What counts as a 5 year period|
	|Your main address must have been here for at least 5 years in a row. You may have been working, studying, retired or unemployed.|
	|It does not matter if you went away on long trips or holidays abroad during this time, as long as your main address was here.|
	|Example|
	|From age 15 to 22, your main address was in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man but, after that, you settled in another country.|
	|This counts as a 5 year period and makes you eligible for jury service.|
	|What does not count|
	|If you had a main address here for shorter periods that were not consecutive, these do not count.|
	|For example, you had a main address here for 2 years. Then at a much later point, you returned here for another 3 years, then we would not add these together.|
	|This would not count as a 5 year period and so you would not be eligible for jury service.|
	|If you're still not sure or you're waiting on a decision from UK Visas and Immigration|
	|You must contact us to get advice on your specific situation.|
